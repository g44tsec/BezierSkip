This is a simplified read me for people who know how to use the elements and console tab within developer tools. Copy the contents of PasteInConsole and then paste it in console (you may need to type in allow pasting if not previously done). Once pasted in console you can press the (del) key to show a menu or rather just press right shift to skip the level you are currently on. Then if you skip all levels and want to show you have a few nodes left use a right click enabler extension and select over the text and edit over the element to the number you want to display (also temporary if a screenshot is needed).
